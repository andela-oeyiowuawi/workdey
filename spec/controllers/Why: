Why:
    Users need a means to be able to indicated if their tasks have been completed.
    They also need to be able to give feedback about the service they got and people who they transacted with.
  This feature addresses the need by:
    Adding a tasksmanagements controller.
    Adding taskmanagement and review models.
    Adding a page that shows all tasks given out by a tasker from which he/she can link to a page to review and/or complete each task.
    Adding a page that allows the tasker to affirm the completion of a task and also review and rate the taskee.
    Also a general rating method that returns the average of all ratings for a particular user.
